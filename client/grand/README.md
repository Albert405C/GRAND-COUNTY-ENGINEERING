                                 This project uses Git LFS to manage large files. Ensure you have Git LFS installed and set up:

                                 1. **Install Git LFS**

                                    ```bash
                                       git lfs install
                                          ```

                                          2. **Track Large Files**

                                             ```bash
                                                git lfs track "*.mp4"
                                                   ```

                                                      Make sure `.gitattributes` is committed to track large files.
